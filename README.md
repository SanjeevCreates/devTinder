Today is the day-1 of my project building we have started with created a new folder manually by having a double click on desktop and then we dragged that folder to the Vscode and in the vscode terminal we ran the command "npm init" but can also run it as "npm init -y" but akshay doesnot preffered it because it will skip some of the questions when we ran the command in the project folder we will get the package.json file and then we execute the command "npm i express" by this we will get the nodemodules and packagelock.json 

~	Tilde	Allows only patch updates (bug fixes) within the specified minor version.

^	Caret	Allows minor and patch updates (new features and bug fixes) while keeping the major version fixed. This is the default for npm install.
